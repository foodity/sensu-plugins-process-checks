#   check-threads-count.rb
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Counts the number of threads running on the system and alerts if that number is greater than the warning or critical values.
#   The default warning and critical count thresholds come from the ~32000 thread limit in older Linux kernels.
#
# OUTPUT:
#   check
#
# PLATFORMS:
#   Linux, Windows
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   gem: sensu-plugin
#   gem: sys-proctable
#
# USAGE:
#   The check will return an UNKNOWN if the sys-proctable version is not new enough to support it.
#
# NOTES:
#   sys-proctable > 0.9.5 is required for counting threads
